ProductivityTimer
=================
# Overview

Productivity Timer is a small application for tracking productivity. 
It tracks the window you are currently using, and matches its title against a predefined keyword list of "productive windows."

As long as the application includes the word in its title, you can use it as a keyword:
* Web site name
* File name (e.g. Important presentation.pptx)
* A person's name
* Email subject
* GitHub repo name
* etc.

# Installation

Compile the solution using Microsoft Visual C# 2010 or newer. Then open the Productivity Timer.exe file. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 is required.
