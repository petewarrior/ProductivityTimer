ProductivityTimer
=================
# Overview

Productivity Timer is a small application for tracking productivity. 
It tracks the window you are currently using, and matches its title against a predefined list of "productive windows."

With this approach, you can include any application, Web site name, or file name as a productive window, as long as the application includes the keyword in its title.

# Installation

Compile the solution using Microsoft Visual C# 2010 or newer. Then open the Productivity Timer.exe file.
